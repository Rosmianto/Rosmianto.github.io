## I'm An Embedded Tinkerer

It's like wizarding, but with no magic. Well, actually there is some sort of magic 
here: Magic Number, and circuits that I don't really know how it worked.

Hello, the name is Aji. A mix of hardware and software guy. I love electronics, I also
love low level programming, but I don't love web programming that much (I know and can use some of webdev concept to build this Github Pages, though).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pmarsceill/test-jtd/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pmarsceill/test-jtd/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
