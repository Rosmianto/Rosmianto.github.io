## I'm An Embedded Tinkerer

It's like wizarding, but with no magic. Well, actually there is some sort of magic 
here: Magic Number, and circuits that I don't really know how it worked.

Hello, the name is Aji. A mix of hardware and software guy. I love electronics, I also
love low level programming, but I don't love web programming that much (I know and can use some of webdev concept to build this Github Pages, though).
