There is no best coding standard. There is only consistent standard.

No need to start another war, this is my coding standard that I use when I code
in C/C++. As long as the style is consistent, it's fine. Yours might be different.

### Whitespace
* Use both spaces and tabs
* Spaces for alignment
* Tabs for indentation
* Use 4 spaces

### Parentheses
* always put a space after ```for```, ```while```, ```if```
* Use egyptian curly brackets

### Variable Naming
* UPPERCASE for ```const``` and ```#define```
* separate_with_underscore for variable name in C
* useCamelCase for variable name in C++
* C++ class always begins with a Capital letter
